<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>Recently graduated software developer with a strong passion for programming and problem-solving.<br>
Previously worked as a professional football player for over 15 years – an experience that has strengthened my ability to collaborate, stay goal-oriented, and remain focused under pressure.<br> 
I am curious, dedicated, and enjoy finding solutions both independently and in collaboration with others.
